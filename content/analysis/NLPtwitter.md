In this project, we will train a Naive Bayes classifier to predict sentiment from thousands of Twitter tweets. This project could be practically used by any company with social media presence to automatically predict customer's sentiment (i.e.: whether their customers are happy or not). The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of tweets and customer reviews.

# Learning Objectives
1. Perform exploratory data analysis and plot word-cloud
2. Apply python libraries to import and visualize dataset
3. Evaluate the performance of trained Naïve Bayes Classifier model using confusion matrices.
4. Train Naïve Bayes classifier models using Scikit-Learn to preform classification
5. Understand the difference between prior probability, posterior probability and likelihood.
6. Understand the theory and intuition behind Naïve Bayes classifiers
7. Perform tokenization to tweet text using Scikit Learn
8. Understand the concept of count vectorization (tokenization)
9. Perform text data cleaning such as removing punctuation and stop words

# PROJECT STRUCTURE
