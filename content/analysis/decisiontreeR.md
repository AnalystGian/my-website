This project is designed for individuals eager to dive into the world of statistical modeling and uncover the stories data can tell through decision trees.
It caters to your curiosity about building and interpreting decision tree classifiers, understanding the relationships and splits within your data, and evaluating
model performance through visualization and diagnostic checks.

Below are the key objectives of this project:
1. Understand the concept of the decision tree algorithm
2. Build decision tree models
3. Evaluate the performance of the model

Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- Task 1: Getting Started
- Task 2: Import Required Packages
- Task 3: Import and Explore data set
- Task 4: Create Train and Test Sets
- Task 5: Train the Decision Tree Model
- Task 6: Evaluating Model Performance
- Task 7: Wrap up
