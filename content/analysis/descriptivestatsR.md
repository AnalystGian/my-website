This project is for people who are interested in data analysis, statistics, and programming in the R programming
language. Descriptive statistics involve summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset, such as central
tendency (mean, median, mode), dispersion (variance, standard deviation), and distribution (skewness, kurtosis). By
using R, a powerful statistical programming language, the project aims to provide a practical demonstration of how
to perform these calculations and analyze data. Therefore, the project is suitable for learners, analysts, researchers,
or anyone interested in gaining proficiency in statistical analysis and data manipulation using R.

Below are the key objectives of this project:
1. Calculate basic descriptive statistics for qualitative variables
2. Calculate basic descriptive statistics for quantitative variables
3. Check the distribution of quantitative variables

Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- Task 1: Getting Started
- Task 2: Import & Explore Data sets
- Task 3: Frequency of categorical variables
- Task 4: Univariate statistics for univariate variables - Part I
- Task 5: Univariate statistics for univariate variables - Part II
- Task 6: Distribution of Quantitative Variables
- Task 7: Bivariate statistics for variables
