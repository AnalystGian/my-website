In this structured series of projects, we will master the fundamentals of data analysis and manipulation with Pandas and Python. Pandas is a super powerful, fast, flexible and easy to use open-source data analysis and manipulation tool. This project is the first of a series of multiple projects (learning path) that is designed for anyone who wants to master data analysis with pandas.

# Learning Objectives
1. Master data analysis and manipulation in Pandas and Python
2. Define and manipulate Pandas Series
3. Master Pandas Attributes, methods and math operations

# Project Structure:
This project is divided into different tasks:

TASK 1: INTRODUCTION

TASK 2: DEFINE PANDAS SERIES

TASK 3: DEFINE PANDAS SERIES WITH CUSTOM INDEX

TASK 4: DEFINE PANDAS SERIES FROM A DICTIONARY

TASK 5: PANDAS ATTRIBUTES

TASK 6: PANDAS METHODS

TASK 7: IMPORT CSV DATA (1-D) USING PANDAS

TASK 8: PANDAS BUILT IN FUNCTIONS

TASK 9: SORTING PANDAS SERIES

TASK 10: PERFORM MATH OPERATIONS ON PANDAS SERIES

TASK 11: CHECK IF GIVEN ELEMENTS EXIST IN A PANDAS SERIES

TASK 12: FINAL CAPSTONE PROJECT
