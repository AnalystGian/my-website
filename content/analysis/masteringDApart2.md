In this structured series of hands-on projects, we will master the fundamentals of data analysis and manipulation with Pandas and Python. Pandas is a super powerful, fast, flexible and easy to use open-source data analysis and manipulation tool. This project is the second of a series of multiple projects (learning path) that is designed for anyone who wants to master data analysis with pandas.

# Learning Objectives
1. Perform Label-based and Integer-based DataFrame indexing
2. Define and manipulate multi-dimensional Pandas DataFrames
3. Master data analysis and manipulation in Pandas and Python

# Project Structure:
This project is divided into different tasks:

TASK 1: INTRO TO PANDAS DATAFRAME FUNDAMENTALS

TASK 2: READ CSV AND HTML DATA

TASK 3: WRITE DATAFRAME INTO CSV

TASK 4: SETTING/RESETTING PANDAS INDEX

TASK 5: SELECT COLUMNS FROM A DATAFRAME

TASK 6: ADD/DELETE DATAFRAME COLUMNS

TASK 7: LABEL-BASED DATAFRAME ELEMENTS SELECTION

TASK 8: INTEGER-BASED DATAFRAME SELECTION

TASK 9: BROADCAST OPERATIONS

TASK 10: SORTING AND ORDERING
