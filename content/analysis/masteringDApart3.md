In this structured series of hands-on projects, we will master the fundamentals of data analysis and manipulation with Pandas and Python. Pandas is a super powerful, fast, flexible and easy to use open-source data analysis and manipulation tool. This project is the third of a series of multiple projects (learning path) that is designed for anyone who wants to master data analysis with pandas.

# Learning Objectives
1. Apply Pandas DataFrame Operations/Filtering Strategies
2. Apply advanced data manipulation, merging and concatenation techniques with Pandas
3. Mastering Pandas DataFrame Operations with Functions

# Project Structure:
This project is divided into different tasks:

TASK 1: DATAFRAMES WITH FUNCTIONS

TASK 2: PANDAS DATAFRAME OPERATIONS/FILTERING

TASK 3: PANDAS DATAFRAME OPERATIONS/FILTERING

TASK 4: DATAFRAME CONCATENATION

TASK 5: DATAFRAME CONCATENATION WITH MULTI-INDEXING

TASK 6: DATA MERGING
