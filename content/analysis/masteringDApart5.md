In this structured series of hands-on projects, we will master the fundamentals of data analysis and manipulation with Pandas and Python. Pandas is a super powerful, fast, flexible and easy to use open-source data analysis and manipulation tool. This project is the fifth of a series of multiple projects (learning path) that is designed for anyone who wants to master data analysis with pandas.

# Learning Objectives
1. Define and manipulate Pandas DataFrames and text data
2. Perform text data cleaning by removing stopwords and punctuations
3. Visualize Pandas DataFrames such as Count plot, Histograms, and Word Cloud

# Project Structure:
This project is divided into different tasks:

TASK 1: LOAD TEXT DATA AND PERFORM BASIC DATA EXPLORATION

TASK 2: UPPER AND LOWER OPERATIONS

TASK 3: FILTER OUT POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE RATINGS

TASK 4: PERFORM PANDAS OPERATIONS PART #1

TASK 5: PERFORM PANDAS OPERATIONS PART #2

TASK 6: PERFORM TEXT DATA CLEANING BY REMOVING PUNCTUATIONS

TASK 7: PERFORM TEXT DATA CLEANING BY REMOVING STOPWORDS

TASK 8: TEXT DATA VISUALIZATION
