In this project, we will build and train classifier models using Scikit-Learn library. Scikit-learn is a free machine learning library developed for python. Scikit-learn offers several algorithms for classification, regression, and clustering.

# Project Structure:
This project is divided into different tasks:

TASK 1: UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND BUSINESS CASE

TASK 2: IMPORT LIBRARIES AND DATASETS

TASK 3: PERFORM EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

TASK 4: CREATE TRAINING AND TESTING DATASET

TASK 5: UNDERSTAND XG-BOOST ALGORITHM TO SOLVE CLASSIFICATION TYPE PROBLEMS

TASK 6: TRAIN AN XG-BOOST CLASSIFIER IN SKLEARN

TASK 7: TEST XG-BOOST CLASSIFIER TO PERFORM INFERENCE
