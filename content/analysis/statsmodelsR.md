This project is for individuals eager to dive into the world of statistical modeling and uncover the stories data can tell.
It caters to your curiosity about building and interpreting linear regression models, understanding relationships within data,
and evaluating model performance through visualization and diagnostic checks.

Below are the key objectives of this project:
1. Build simple and multiple linear regression models
2. Perform model assessment and interpretation of results
3. Perform diagnostic checks to test for model assumptions

Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- Task 1: Getting Started
- Task 2: Import packages and dataset
- Task 3: Explore the dataset
- Task 4: Data Visualization
- Task 5: Model Building
- Task 6: Model Assessment I
- Task 7: Model Assessment II
- Task 8: Model Prediction
- Task 9: Checking Assumptions: Diagnostic Plots
