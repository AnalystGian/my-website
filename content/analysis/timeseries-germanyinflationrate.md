This project is for individuals interested in analyzing seasonal trends through time series analysis. Using Germany inflation data from Statbureau, we perform seasonal decomposition, apply Seasonal ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing with ETS models, and conduct time series cross-validation. The insights are valuable for economic research, financial analysis, and business planning.

You can download the dataset in [statbureau](https://www.statbureau.org/en/germany/inflation-tables) website

Below are the key objectives of this project:
1. Import and preprocess the Germany inflation dataset for time series analysis.
2. Perform seasonal decomposition to identify and understand seasonal patterns.
3. Apply Seasonal ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing with ETS models for forecasting.
4. Conduct time series cross-validation to evaluate and compare model performance.

Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- Task 1: Getting Started
- Task 2: Importing the Data
- Task 3: Seasonal Decomposition
- Task 4: Seasonal ARIMA
- Task 5: Exponential Smoothing with ETS
- Task 6: Time Series Cross Validation
