This project is for individuals interested in analyzing trends over time through time series analysis. Using a dataset from Gapminder, we focus on identifying patterns and forecasting future trends. The insights gained are applicable in scientific research, economics, and business analytics.

Below are the key objectives of this project:
1. Import and preprocess the Gapminder dataset for time series analysis.
2. Implement and analyze the Holt Linear Trend Model and Holt Linear Trend Model - Damped.
3. Utilize the ARIMA model for forecasting and compare the performance of different models.

Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- Task 1: Getting Started
- Task 2: Importing the Data
- Task 3: Using Holt Linear Trend Model
- Task 4: Using Holt Linear Trend Model - Damped
- Task 5: Using ARIMA Model
- Task 6: Model Comparison
