This project analyzes historical toy data to track key metrics,
explore high-level trends, and build a simple but interactive KPI report.

Below are the key objectives of this project:
1. Connect to the source data files, conduct basic profiling and QA tasks.
2. Create a relational data model by defining relationships between fact and dimension tables,
    creating simple hierarchies, and adjusting model properties.
3. Enhance the data model, prepare for analysis by defining new measures and calculated fields.
4. Visualize the data and create an interactive report to show orders, revenue and profit over time and by product category.

The project includes files:
1. 4 source files (calendar.csv, products.csv, sales.csv, stores.csv)
2. Toy Store KPI Report (pbix)
3. Data Dictionary (csv)
4. Analysis Report (pptx)

Below are the steps done in this project:
- Task 1. Connect to source files
- Task 2. QA & Data Profiling
- Task 3. Conduct ETL process
