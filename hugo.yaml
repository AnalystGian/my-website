      I am a mathematics teacher with a strong foundation in algebra, geometry, probability, and statistics. I also pursued graduate-level studies in mathematics, where I explored linear algebra, set theory and logic, statistics, number theory, and modern geometry.

      I am passionate about applying data analytics and data science to solve real-world problems, using tools like Python, R, SQL, and Power BI to explore, visualize, and model data. I enjoy turning insights into actionable solutions that can help people and organizations make informed decisions.
